Three programs written to practice writing static methods and calling static methods from the main method, expressing control flow using conditionals and time-based calculations. Built with Java.

## Program explanation

To run tests, read the following 

Program 1 will takes in 1 input x and calculate the factorial value abd sum of the squares for the number series ending for x, while also prints the fibonacci sequence for x elements of the sequence. 

For example: x = 9

Output:

The factorial of 9 is 362880

The sum of squares is 285

1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55 

Program 2 will prompt the user to choose an option for a shape. Then, depending on the shape, ask for the radius, width, length and output the area and either of circumference or perimeter for that shape.

For example: Choose 2 for Circle shape and enter 3.5 for the radius

Output:

When the radius is 3.5 the circumference is 22 and the area is 38

Program 3 is an age calculator that takes in a list of values from an input file that contains Month, Day, and Year and calculate the appropriate age.

For exmaple: 07-08-1999

Output:

The age is 22 years old for 07-08-1999
